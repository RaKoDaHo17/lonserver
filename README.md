LoN Server
===
About
---
Fork of the 2 years old outdated project, emulates LoL server environment. Includes Spudgy's changes.

Client requirements
---
* Windows OS (Wine users might get it to work somehow as well), as the batch is written for Windows
* League of Legends 4.5 or EARLIER (4.4 etc) - not really sure about 4.6, but **4.7 and 4.8 surely won't work!**
* Any text editor to put the right RADS path into the batch file

Instructions (server + client)
---
* Compile the server (gamed)
* Start the server (gamed)
* Edit the RADS path inside launch.bat (just enter the path to your RADS folder, the one which contains projects, solutions etc)

Command line parameters (server)
---
* Server port (optional, defaults to 5119). 
For example:
```bat
gamed.exe 3113
```
